# Serverless Web Application Using AWS  
HEPro Internship – Cloud Engineering Project  
Author: Keerthi  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on designing and deploying a fully serverless web application using Amazon Web Services (AWS).  
The goal is to understand cloud-native architecture, utilize AWS managed services, and build a scalable, cost-efficient solution without managing traditional servers.

This project is part of the HEPro Cloud Engineering Internship.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a functional serverless web application.
- Learn and apply AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, IAM, and CloudWatch.
- Design a clean architecture that is scalable and cost-optimized.
- Deploy the application and document the full development workflow.
- Submit a final project report covering architecture, implementation steps, and testing results.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview (Planned)
The application will follow a standard serverless architecture:

- **Frontend** → Amazon S3 (Static website hosting)  
- **Backend** → AWS Lambda functions  
- **API Layer** → Amazon API Gateway  
- **Database** → Amazon DynamoDB  
- **Authentication (Optional)** → Amazon Cognito  
- **Monitoring & Logs** → Amazon CloudWatch  
- **Permissions & Access Control** → AWS IAM  

A final architecture diagram will be added upon project completion.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **AWS Lambda** (Compute)
- **Amazon API Gateway** (API Exposure)
- **DynamoDB** (Database)
- **Amazon S3** (Frontend Hosting / Storage)
- **CloudWatch** (Monitoring + Logs)
- **AWS IAM** (Access Management)
- **HTML/CSS/JS or React** (Frontend – TBD)
